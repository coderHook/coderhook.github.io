       <p>I plan to change my career, at this moment I am working as a sales agent in a shoe factory, and my intention is
       to become a data scientist, my competences includes research, product design, engineering and deployment.
       I also love to learn, I think one of the best motivation that you can get in live is when you have somehing new
       to learn which is fantastic because there is always room for improvement.</p>

       <p>I also love web development, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/coderhook" title="My freecodecamp profile"
       itemprop="url"><span itemprop="nickname">coderHook Web developer</span></a> here you can see all the codes that I programmed in Javascript,
       jQuery, React.js, css, d3.js, node.js, express.js and most of their libraries. I do not
       pigeonhole myself to specific languages or frameworks. A good developer
       is receptive and has the ability to learn new technologies. I like to
       contribute to other projects, at this moment I am contributing in a meetUP group <a href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Alicante-Data-Science-Meetup/" itemprop="url">Alicante Data Science </a>.</p>

       <p>Besides programming, I love sports, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)" title="Ultimate Frisbee" itemprop="url">Ultimate Frisbee</a> is my passion
       and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacklining" itemprop="url"> Slacklining </a> gave me a lot of concentration and
       peace of mind, basically when you are on the cord you cannot thing in so many things at a time :)
       </p>

       <p>English is my second language. My mother tongue is Spanish and I always love to learn new words in exotic languages so I encourage you to teach me something.</p></div>"""}
